In 2009, after obtaining my Bachelor degree in Physics from Nanjing University, China, 
I joined the University of Regina, Canada as a Ph.D student, 
where my adventure in high- energy physics started. 
For the first couple of years I learned physics analysis and detector performance and then, 
in 2011, I seized the opportunity to work with Prof. Sau Lan Wu at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
Since then, my research project was sitting squarely at the forefront of scientific inquiry: 
the search for the Higgs boson in the H &rarr; ZZ &rarr; 4l final state (the four- lepton analysis). 
In the four-lepton analysis team, I played a leading role in the observation of a Standard Model (SM) 
Higgs boson and subsequent measure- ments of its properties using the LHC Run 1 data. 
In 2015, LHC started to deliver proton–proton collision data at an unprecedented center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, which may open a portal to beyond the SM physics. With this new regime in mind I started to investigate the nature of dark matter (DM) by looking for DM candidates through mono-X final states, where X can be an energetic jet or a Higgs boson. I produced the first mono-Higgs results using 13 TeV data for the 2015 End-of-Year-Event at CERN. In 2016, whilst search- ing for DM candidates in the mono-jet final state, I expanded my interest to addressing the question of “Are there other Higgs bosons in nature”. In the extended Higgs boson sector, I am recently assigned as an ATLAS contact in the LHC Higgs cross section working group for beyond the SM Higgs, in part because I played a crucial role in the search for an additional scalar in the ZZ final states as an analysis contact person and a publication editor. While leading analysis team in the four-lepton analysis, I played an important role in the search for beyond the SM resonances in the diphoton final state as a supporting note editor for measuring the fraction of prompt photons in signal regions. Currently, I expanded my research experience from data analysis to preparations for module production in the Phase-2 pixel upgrade at Berkeley Lab. More specifically, I am working on building a wafer-probing station and performing electronic tests on the RD53A pixel readout chip.
