I presented the search for heavy ZZ resonances in ATLAS with 13 TeV data. Two excesses were found with four-lepton invariant mass at around 240 GeV and 700 GeV, each with a local significance of 3.4 standard deviations and a global significance of 2.2 standard deviations. More data are needed to confirm or reject the two excesses.
