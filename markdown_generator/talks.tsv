Background estimation in four-lepton analysis	Talk@HZZ workshop	t	Laboratoire de l'Accelerateur Lineaire-Orsay	2012-10-10	Orsay, France		I presented the estimation of reducible background in the four-lepton analysis in the ATLAS HZZ workshop. 
Observation of the new Higgs-like particle in the four-lepton decay channel with the ATLAS detector	Poster@Conference	p	CERN	2013-03-13	Geneva, Switzerland	https://cds.cern.ch/record/1522394/files/ATL-COM-PHYS-2013-253.pdf	It describes the observation of a Higgs-like particle in the four-lepton decay channel with the ATLAS detector and presicion measurements of its properties, including the mass of the particle, its coupling to fermions and vector bosons, its spin and parity.

Observation and coupling measurements of the Higgs boson in the four-lepton decay mode	Talk@US ATLAS General Meeting	t	Argonne National Laboratory	2013-07-17	Lemont, IL, US		The measured Higgs coupling to fermions and vector boson in the four-lepton channel were reported.
Observation and measurements of the Higgs boson in the four-lepton decay mode	Talk@International Symposium on Higgs Physics	t	IHEP	2013-08-15	Beijing, China	http://indico.ihep.ac.cn/event/3029/session/5/contribution/47/material/slides/0.pdf	I presented the observation of the Higgs boson and the measurement of its properties in the four-lepton final state.
Selected key perspectives of H $\rightarrow$ ZZ analysis in LHC Run 2	Talk@Higgs workshop	t	Sapienza Universita di Roma	2014-04-18	Rome, Italy	https://indico.cern.ch/event/289241/contributions/1643578/attachments/540089/744431/HiggsWorkshop_Rome_20140418_v2.pdf	LHC was expected to start its second run of proton-proton collisions at an unprecedented center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in proton-proton collision data. I were representing the four-lepton analysis team to present the highlighted perspectives our analysis want to focus in the coming LHC Run 2.
